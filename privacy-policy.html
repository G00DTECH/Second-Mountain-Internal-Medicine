                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2 class="subsection-title">Maine State Privacy Protections</h2>
                    <p>In addition to federal HIPAA requirements, your health information is protected under Maine law, specifically <strong>Title 22, Section 1711-C of the Maine Revised Statutes</strong> (Confidentiality of Health Care Information). Key protections under Maine law include:</p>
                    <ul class="checkmark-list">
                        <li>Individual health care information is confidential and may not be disclosed except as permitted by law or with your consent.</li>
                        <li>Health care information includes any information that directly identifies you and relates to your physical, mental, or behavioral health condition, personal or family medical history, or the health care provided to you.</li>
                        <li>Any agreement to waive these confidentiality protections is against public policy and void under Maine law.</li>
                        <li>When Maine law provides stricter privacy protections than HIPAA, this Practice follows the more protective standard.</li>
                    </ul>
