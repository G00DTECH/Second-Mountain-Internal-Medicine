                    <h4>What to Expect</h4>
                    <p>Dr. Matulis will come to your home—whether that's your own house, an assisted living facility, or a family member's home. Visits typically last 45-60 minutes. He'll bring the equipment needed for a thorough exam, can order labs and imaging, adjust medications, and coordinate with any specialists you see.</p>
                    <p class="highlight-text">You'll see the same doctor every time. No rotating providers. No starting over.</p>

                    <p class="highlight-text">We're here to help carry that weight.</p>

                    <h4>What We Do for Families</h4>
                    <ul class="checkmark-list">
                        <li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> We communicate with family members (with patient permission) about care plans and changes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medication review:</strong> We look at everything in the medicine cabinet—prescribed and otherwise—and simplify where possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Care coordination:</strong> We work with specialists, home health agencies, and other providers so you don't have to chase down records.</li>
                        <li><strong>Honest conversations:</strong> We'll talk with you about what to expect, what's realistic, and what your loved one's wishes are.</li>
                        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Call or text with questions. You shouldn't have to wait for an appointment to get answers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>You Can Be Present for Visits</h4>
                    <p>Family members are welcome to join home visits. This is often when the best conversations happen—when everyone is in the same room, asking questions, and making plans together.</p>

                    <h4>Close the Loop on Discharge</h4>
                    <p>You know the patients who are going to bounce back. The ones without reliable primary care. The ones who can't get to follow-up appointments. The ones whose home situation is a black box.</p>
                    <p class="highlight-text">We can help.</p>

                    <h4>What We Offer Referring Providers</h4>
                    <ul class="checkmark-list">
                        <li><strong>Rapid intake:</strong> We can often see patients within days of discharge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medication reconciliation:</strong> We verify what's actually being taken at home.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ongoing primary care:</strong> Not just a single transitional care visit—we become their PCP.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We send visit notes and stay in the loop with the care team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced readmissions:</strong> Proactive home-based care keeps patients out of the hospital.</li>
                        <li><strong>Same-day homecare orders:</strong> Dr. Matulis signs homecare orders within one day so services get started promptly.</li>

                        <p>Medicare covers medically necessary home visits for patients who have difficulty leaving their home. This includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home visits from a physician</li>

                        <p>For most patients with Traditional Medicare and a supplemental (Medigap) policy, there is little to no out-of-pocket cost for home visits.</p>
                        <p>If you have Traditional Medicare without a supplement, you may be responsible for the standard 20% coinsurance after your deductible is met.</p>
