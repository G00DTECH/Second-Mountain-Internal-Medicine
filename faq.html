                <h3 class="faq-group-title">About Our Care</h3>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">Is this real primary care, or just one-time house calls?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">This is real, ongoing primary care. Dr. Matulis becomes your primary care physician—seeing you regularly, managing your chronic conditions, and being available when you need him. This is not an urgent care or one-time visit service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">Do I have to give up my current doctors?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">Not necessarily. Dr. Matulis serves as your primary care physician. You can keep seeing specialists as needed—we'll coordinate with them. If you have an existing PCP you want to keep, we can discuss how to structure care, but most patients transition fully to our practice.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">How often will the doctor visit?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">Visit frequency depends on your medical needs. Some patients are seen monthly; others every few months. After a hospitalization or when conditions are unstable, we may visit more frequently. We'll work with you to determine the right schedule.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">Can family members be present during visits?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">Absolutely. We encourage it. Having family present helps everyone stay informed and involved in care decisions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">What is a DO?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">A DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) is a fully licensed physician who can prescribe medication, perform procedures, and specialize in any area of medicine—just like an MD. DOs complete rigorous medical training and are held to the same standards. Many emphasize a whole-person approach to care.</p>

                <!-- Costs & Insurance -->
                <h3 class="faq-group-title">Costs &amp; Insurance</h3>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">How much does this cost?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">For patients with Traditional Medicare and a Medigap supplement, most visits have little to no out-of-pocket cost. We bill Medicare directly. This is not a concierge practice—we don't charge membership fees.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">Do you accept Medicare Advantage plans?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">Currently, we only accept Traditional (Original) Medicare—the red, white, and blue card. We do not participate in Medicare Advantage plans. If you're not sure what type of Medicare you have, we can help you figure it out.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">What if I need to see a doctor urgently?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">Call or text us. We do our best to be available and responsive. For true medical emergencies (chest pain, stroke symptoms, severe breathing difficulty, etc.), call 911.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">What happens after hours or on weekends?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">For emergencies, always call 911. For non-emergency concerns, please call or text our main number and we will respond as soon as possible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">What does "homebound" mean? Do I have to be bedridden?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">No, you don't have to be bedridden. "Homebound" for Medicare purposes means that leaving your home is difficult and requires considerable effort. You might need help from another person, a wheelchair or walker, or special transportation. Occasional trips to the doctor, church, or a family event don't disqualify you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item-full">
                    <h3 class="faq-question-full">Can you see patients in assisted living facilities?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer-full">Yes. We provide care wherever you live—your own home, a family member's home, assisted living, or residential care facilities. We do not provide care in skilled nursing facilities (nursing homes) that have their own medical staff.</p>
